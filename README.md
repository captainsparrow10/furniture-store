### Author's words

In this project, I approved of myself, I never take the time to developer my own project. It's my first time I do this. I'ld  want to see that I can do. I know this isn't how to should begin a project, but for me, I'ld  like to tak of my experience about how I did this project. 

I spend months without code, because I felt a failed as developer. Although, I walked up because I said: "here, it's not the end of my dream", read, watch videos, design, and I did that I could do to get out my project to the light. I know with the time, I'll improve the app in more of thing than actually It doesn't have, but for now, the only want I care is the app and initial propose, It's doing. 

The people who read this,I want to know that maybe you don't see the best project of your life, but this project, It did me cried, It did me felt stupid, I didn't understand anything, I didn't know nothing, I should be give up, I don't make for this. Do you know why I write this? Because if some moment or some day in your life, you left like me, you aren't alone in this, I'll tell you something: "You're doing the things right, congratulations". In this point, the most people in the world, when you're understand anything is when you prove yourself what kind of people you are. You want to take the easy wave, you want to give up, it's okay. But, if you want to became someone, You need to put your men pants and walk up. I give up every day but for myself, I never say to other about that, why? because I always say: "The next month my project out" something like that although I don't have idea how to do it. Now, looking me, something suppose don't know english, writing this readme. Yeah, I'm practicing my english read now. I tell you another thing, every day, I see this project, why? I need to remember: "You're a not bad in this". One day, I cant to say: "I'm here for myself"

So, remember: "There's not greater satisfaction than you get something with your own hands"
